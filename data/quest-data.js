        It is wednesday which means the horde of seniors has decended upon us. The smell of mothballs and entitlement wafts through the air as one of them approaches you with a bigger frown than normal. They are angry becuase the store does not have their prune juice and ask why the shelves are empty. What do you do?

            You explain to the senior that because a plague has decended upon the land the supply chain has been interrupted and nobody wants work, making stores unable to provide their wares. The senior doesn't care and says back when they were younger people would walk to work in 10 feet of snow even if they had the plague.

As tie grags on you slowly die inside but don't budge.He eventually asks to speak to a manager and the manager apologizes and lets the man shop with no mask on but a smug look on his face.
